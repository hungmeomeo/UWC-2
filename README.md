# Urban waste collection aid - UWC 2.0
# Introduction
Many countries around the world are dealing with several major issues, and one of them is managing urban waste. Consequently, it is considered a crucial aspect to address when aiming to achieve Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 11, which focuses on sustainable cities and communities, and SDG 6, which is about clean water and sanitation. Developing countries, which prioritize development and economic growth, receive special attention in this regard. Solid waste management is expensive and not very effective in urban settings. Governments and organizations are emphasizing the need to improve waste collection and management to have positive impacts on cities, societies, and the environment. So UWC - 2.0 was developed in order to improve efficiency of garbage collection.

The UWC 2.0 is an information management system that is designed to improve the efficiency of garbage collection for Service Provider Y in urban areas. The system includes a Task Management module that allows back officers, collectors, and janitors to manage their tasks and assignments in a more efficient and coordinated manner.
